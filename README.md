Trimmer Braun Clipper - 6cm


I have reverse-engineered and designed a trimmer attachment compatible with Braun products.
The design features Class A surfacing for a smooth exterior. The geometry has been optimized
to achieve approximately 50% mass reduction while enhancing stiffness.

For manufacturing, Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is recommended to accurately realize all
the required features.

Add notch and increase the length of combs accordingly to get required length setting.
